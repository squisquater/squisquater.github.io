## Postdoctoral Research 
*  Exploring the effects of disease outbreaks on metapopulation connectivity, genetic diversity, and inbreeding-load in the San Joaquin kit fox (*Vulpes macrotis mutica*).

## Dissertation Research 
*  Maintenance of a narrow hybrid zone between native and introduced red foxes (*Vulpes vulpes*) despite conspecificity and high dispersal capabilities
*  Population genomics reveals distinct demographic histories among extant gray fox (*Urocyon*) lineages in North America
*  Whole genome sequencing reveals recent and ongoing admixture between highly divergent gray fox (*Urocyon*) lineages

## Ongoing Research Projects
*  Demographic history of red foxes in North America
*  Comparative morphology of red foxes along elevational gradients

## Past Research Projects
*  Occupancy, Habitat, and Abundance of the Sacramento Valley Red Fox 
*  A review of wildlife camera trapping trends across Africa
